        <h1>Causes Of Climate Change</h1>
       
        <p>Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted from, and are reabsorbed by, a variety of natural sources, but the rate
            at which human economies and societies are emitting these gases far exceeds the capacity of natural
            ecosystems to reabsorb them. Increased industrial activity since the mid-18th century has led to a rapid
            increase in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, in
            large part due to the burning of fossil fuels derived from oil, coal and natural gas.

            The rate of emissions has been steadily increasing over time, and computer models of the earth's climate
            system (including both natural and human causes) are unable to simulate recent warming unless they include
            anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.

            Land-based human activities, such as forest clearing and unsustainable agricultural practices, are not only
            increasing GHG emissions from these sources, but are also reducing the earth’s natural ability to absorb
            GHGs. The evidence that current global warming is due to human activities associated with industrialisation
            and modern agriculture is overwhelming</p>

                <p>While natural factors have caused significant climate shifts throughout Earth's history, their
                    contribution to the current rapid warming is considered to be much smaller than that of human
                    activities. These natural drivers include:

                        <p>Volcanic eruptions can impact the climate, both by warming and cooling the planet.
                            Large eruptions inject sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere, where it forms sulfuric
                            acid droplets (aerosols). These aerosols reflect sunlight back into space, leading to a
                            temporary cooling effect, which can last for a few years. In the long term, volcanic
                            eruptions also release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, which can contribute to
                            warming
                            These substances can reflect solar radiation back into space, temporarily cooling the
                            Earth.However, long-term climate effects may arise if eruptions occur frequently over a
                            geologic period</p>

                            significant cause of climate change. Ocean currents, driven by wind and density differences

                            from the equator towards the poles, influencing regional and global climate patterns.
                            Changes in
                            these currents, often caused by alterations in temperature and salinity, can lead

                        <p>Earth's orbital changes, known as Milankovitch cycles, are a natural cause of climate change,
                            specifically over long time scales. These changes involve variations in the Earth's orbit
                            shape,
                            axial tilt, and
